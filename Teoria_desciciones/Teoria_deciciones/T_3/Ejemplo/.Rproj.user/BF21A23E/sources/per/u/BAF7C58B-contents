1. In the example in this chapter we estimated the probabilities of choosing differ-
ent modes by sidewalk density setting travel time to the in-sample median. Use

model2 to calculate the probability of choosing different modes by in-sample
median sidewalk density but now for travel times of 20, 30, and 40 min. Discuss
the results.


2. Estimate a model using formula f3 (call it model3). Discuss the output of this
model.

```{r}
f3 <- mFormula(choice ~ 0 | sidewalk_density | time)
f3 |>  model.matrix(example_long)
```

```{r}
# Function `mlogit()` is used to estimate logit models
# It needs a multi-part formula and a data set in long form
model3 <- mlogit(f3, mc_commute_long)
# Function `summary()` give the summary of data objects,
# including the output of model estimation algorithms
summary(model3)
```



3. Use model3 to calculate the probability of choosing different modes by in-
sample median sidewalk density but now for travel times of 20, 30, and 40 min.

Discuss the results.
4. In the general case, what is the value of the log-likelihood of the null (Equally
Likely) model?
5. Use the likelihood ratio test to compare model3 to model2? Discuss the results.
What restrictions would you need to impose in model3 to obtain model2?
