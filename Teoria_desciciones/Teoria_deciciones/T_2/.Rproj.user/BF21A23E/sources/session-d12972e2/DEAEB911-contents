1. Why is EDA an important part of a modeling exercise?
2. How many aesthetic elements of visualization can you think of? List them and
explain how they could be mapped to variables in different scales.
3. The data set explored in this chapter was in wide format: each row was a single
respondent. However, discrete choice data is often found in long format: each row
is a choice situation, and each individual now appears in the table as many times
as they faced a choice situation. Would this change in any way how you approach
data analysis?
4. How many variables are there in this data set and of which type (i.e., categorical/quantitative)?


```{r}
data("Car")
glimpse(Car)


Car$college <- factor(Car$college, levels = c("0", "1"), labels = c("No", "Yes"))

summary(Car)
```
```{r}
car_alluvia <- Car |> 
  select(college, type1, type2, choice) |> 
  group_by(college, type1, type2, choice) |> 
  summarize(frequency = n(), .groups = "drop")
```




```{r}
car_alluvia |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = frequency, axis1 = college, axis2 = type1, axis3 = type2, axis4=choice)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = college), width = 1/12, color = "black") +
  geom_stratum(width = 1/4, fill = "black", color = "grey") +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), color = "white", size = 3) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("College", "Type 1","Type 2", "Choice"), expand = c(.05, .05)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}

car_alluvia |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = frequency, axis1 = college, axis2 = type1, axis3=choice)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = college), width = 1/12, color = "black") +
  geom_stratum(width = 1/3, fill = "black", color = "grey") +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), color = "white", size = 3) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("College", "Type 1", "Choice"), expand = c(.05, .05)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

5. Choose four relevant categorical variables from this data set and describe them
using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques. Discuss your results.
6. What ideas about individualsâ€™ choices regarding car do you develop from this
EDA exercise?

















































```{r}
library(tibble)

# Suponiendo que "Datos" es una columna dentro del dataframe "Muestras"
Datos <- tibble(Datos = Muestras$Datos)

```
```
